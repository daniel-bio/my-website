  <h2>Work</h2>
  <p>I didn’t plan to go into field service—but I chose it because I wanted to be in the biotech environment. I wanted to see how things worked, talk to the people doing research, and be in the room with the tools. Being around the instruments every day helped me understand the systems that make science possible. I’ve learned the most during repairs—tinkering, asking questions, and figuring things out with coworkers. I like the order of it all, and I like that it matters.</p>
  <p>Now I want to take what I’ve learned and get closer to the research itself. I want to help shape the questions, not just support them. I’m interested in where biology and data come together—and how that intersection can help people live and feel better.</p>
