    <p>I'm always trying to better understand how things work — in science, engineering, and life in general. I enjoy working at the intersection of biology and technology, and I like solving problems both hands-on and by thinking things through. Whether I'm learning, building, or exploring new ideas, I care about doing things thoughtfully and staying grounded in the human side of everything I do.</p>
